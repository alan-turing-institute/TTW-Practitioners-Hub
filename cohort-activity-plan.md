# _The Turing_ Way Practitioners Hub


## Experts and Residence: Full Cohort Activity Plan

**Background**

_[The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome) is a flagship project of The Alan Turing Institute. Shared as an open source community-driven handbook on data science, the project promotes best practices for reproducible, ethical, inclusive and collaborative research. To date, **450+ diverse contributors** from international organisations have collaborated to develop 313+ chapters and resources, which are available across** guides on reproducibility, project design, communication, collaboration, research ethics and community**. Hosted under the[ Tools, Practices and Systems](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/tools-practices-and-systems) Research Programme, the project draws expertise from the institute’s Community Management, Research Application Management, Academic Skills and Research Engineering Teams._

**The Turing Way Practitioners Hub is an extension of The Turing Way** to engage directly with experts from partnering organisations in their efforts to promote data science best practices. The Practitioners Hub provides a forum for cross-sector engagement, knowledge exchange and strategic collaboration across academia, research, engineering systems, government and healthcare-leading data science initiatives. Through the involvement of domain experts from different sectors, the Practitioners Hub will enable systematic approaches for building a shared understanding of open science, reproducibility, accessibility and research ethics to enhance quality, rigour and integrity in data science and AI.

The first “Experts in Residence” (EiR) cohort has been joined by the data science best practice champions from the **British Antarctic Survey, Energy Systems Catapult, Genomics England, and Office of National Statistics and Digihaul**. Learn about our EiRs on our **website**: [https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/turing-way-practitioners-hub](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/turing-way-practitioners-hub).

In this document, we provide the Practitioners Hub activities to guide engagement activities among them, with The Turing Way community and the broader Turing network, including the BridgeAI that is a part funder of this Project.

## **Full cohort activity plan**

### Overview of the EiR engagement plan

* **Pre-cohort communication: Why** are EiRs working together?

  * **Goal:** EiRs will share current best practices from their respective sectors, exchange knowledge about how they support the adoption of best practices and combine their skills/resources to scale their efforts across sectors.

  * **Onboarding process:**
    - 1. Share priming document with accompanying presentation
        2. Onboarding survey to help identify goals for their respective projects before the kick-off session
        3. Themed meetings for the full cohort have been planned based on their goals and responses to the onboarding
* **Knowledge Mapping Stage (Month 1-3): Who** are we working with, for, within and beyond our respective organisations? 
    A. Stakeholder mapping - drawing from community management practices
    C. Mapping user journey for your project - User Design Research
    C. Skills/knowledge gap analysis
* **Roadmap for the implementation stage (Month 4-6): How and When** are we hoping to scale efforts in our respective organisations?
    6. Applying pedagogy of learning and technical teaching 
    7. Roadmapping insights from catapults (considering innovation, impact and value)
    8. Regulation and ethical consideration in our roadmap 

**Practising open working: What** are we doing individually and as a group?
* Sharing the sector-specific practices through case studies (supported by a technical writer)
* Coworking at Collaboration Café with group-based discussion
* Slack channel (for EiRs as well as the broader Turing Way community) to share thoughts, resources and updates asynchronously
* _The Turing Way_ community-wide events to engage with experts and community members with shared goals and interests (Practitioners Hub workshops, Fireside Chat, Book Dash)
* Creating events to connect EiRs and the Practitioners Hub activities with The Turing Way and the broader Turing network, including the BridgeAI resources.
* Centralising learnings and resources on GitHub: [https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/TTW-Practitioners-Hub/](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/TTW-Practitioners-Hub/) and Website: [https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/turing-way-practitioners-hub](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/turing-way-practitioners-hub).

## Review GROW Model to assess EiRs progress



* **Goal**: Agree on a topic & objective or longer-term goals
    * What do you want to achieve?
    * What will happen when you have succeeded?
    * Goals can be SMART ( Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time-bound)
* **Reality**: self-assessment, specific examples
    * What is happening at the moment?
    * What stops you from moving on?
    * What have you tried?
    * What happened?
    * What have you learned?
* **Options**: suggestions offered & choices made
    * What could you do? What else?
    * What are the advantages/disadvantages of each option?
    * Would you like suggestions from me?
    * What options do you like the most?
* **The way forward**: next steps
    * What will you do?
    * What will be the first step?
    * When precisely are you going to start and finish each step?
    * What support do you need and from whom?
