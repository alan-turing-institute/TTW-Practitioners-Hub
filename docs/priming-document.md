_[The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome)_ is a flagship project of [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/). 
Shared as an open source community-driven handbook on data science, the project promotes best practices for reproducible, ethical, inclusive and collaborative research. 
To date, **400+ diverse contributors** from international organisations have collaborated to develop 300+ chapters and resources, which are available across guides on reproducibility, project design, communication, collaboration, research ethics and community. 
Hosted under the [Tools, Practices and Systems](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/tools-practices-and-systems) Research Programme, the project draws expertise from the institute’s Community Management, Research Application Management, Academic Skills and Research Engineering Teams.

To embed data science best practices and community expertise into different sectors, we are launching **_The Turing Way_ Practitioners Hub** this year. 
The Practitioners Hub will provide a forum for cross-sector engagement, knowledge exchange and strategic collaboration with organisations across academia, research, engineering systems, government and healthcare leading data science initiatives. 
Through the involvement of domain experts from these sectors, the Practitioners Hub will enable systematic approaches for building a shared understanding of open science, reproducibility, accessibility and research ethics to enhance quality, rigour and integrity in data science and AI.


## What’s in it for you / your organisation:

In 2023, _The Turing Way_ team is **partnering with five organisations in the UK to run the** **6 months long inaugural cohort of the Practitioners Hub**. 
With an overarching goal to accelerate the adoption of best practices in the partnering organisations, the Practitioners Hub will: support the co-creation of case studies highlighting the impacts of data science; embed community practices in different teams; and foster a network of ‘experts in residence’.

Initial engagements from the collaborators in the Practitioners Hub will lead to the following outputs:

* **Case studies and impact reports**: Our research team will support the co-creation of a case study highlighting examples, use cases and projects from your organisation capturing the application of best practices and their impact in your sector. These will be shared in _The Turing Way_ and with the Practitioners Hub partners enabling cross-exchange of skills and expertise, as well as extending the impact of your work through their transfer in different sectors.
* **Specialised workshops and skill profiling:** Through consulting and workshops facilitated by _The Turing Way _team of Community and Research Applications professionals, we will co-develop a comprehensive report profiling stakeholders map, data skills landscape and pathways for your team to improve awareness and adoption of data science practices in your organisation.

All partners will have access to curated opportunities from the Turing’s [Research Programmes](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research) and [partnership network](https://www.turing.ac.uk/opportunities-turing), which include events and collaborative projects; Funding and fellowship calls; training and skill-building events; and research and communication outputs.


### “Expert in Residence” - Recognising champions from your network

Each organisation will have the opportunity to nominate a champion from their organisation, who will be awarded and recognised as an “expert in residence” at the Practitioners Hub. Each expert will be allocated a budget to be used towards honoraria, bursary or **salary equivalent of 0.2 FTE for up to 6 months**. 

Serving as an ambassador of best practices for their organisation, the “experts in residence” will strengthen the representation of their organisations and meaningful engagement in the Practitioners Hub. As the main points of contact, they will carry out the activities of their interest to promote reproducible, ethical and collaborative data science skills in their organisations and beyond. Examples of activities include, but are not limited to:

* Co-developing a customised roadmap and tooling for training activities to strengthen interdisciplinary collaboration required in your organisation.
* Co-organising training workshops with _The Turing Way_ team to engage researchers from your organisation/network in data skills such as version control, programming skills, Open Science practices, computational reproducibility, Research Data Management and FAIR principles.
* Co-hosting a [Book Dash](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/bookdash.html) (a hackathon-like event) and/or [Fireside Chats](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/fireside-chat.html) (a virtual community panel), to enable collaboration and knowledge sharing in _The Turing Way _platforms and book.
* Participating in Community of Practice training to build skills and gain frameworks for identifying stakeholders and engagement pathways to help your community collaborate and achieve shared goals in data science.

**Joining _The Turing Way_ Practitioners Hub:**

We are delighted to invite you to join _The Turing Way_ Practitioners Hub. To confirm your participation in the inaugural programme of the Practitioners Hub, please send us **the name and email of the contact person**.
